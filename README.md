# OS-Teacher-Student

FIRST
Firstly, I have made an array of resources where 0,1,2 represents pen,paper and question paper respectively. I have used rand() function so that teacher can put any 2 items randomly and of course, to make program more robust. To avoid printing any condition twice, I have used flag array . to exit, I have coded a condition when all elements of flag array are 1,then it will exit. 

Console:
Teacher Placed :-

1st Item = Question-Paper
2nd Item = Paper

User having Pen completed the work.

Teacher Placed :-

1st Item = Paper
2nd Item = Pen

Student having Question-Paper completed the work.

Teacher Placed :-

1st Item = Question-Paper
2nd Item = Pen

User having Paper completed the work.




SECOND
Firstly ,I came to know number of faculty and students who are there to issue book. Then I asked user to enter their arrival time and store it into arrays. If there are only students ,then we have different conditions . If there are only faculty ,then we have different conditions .If we have both students and faculties ,we have different condition as clearly mentioned in the program.

Console:
Enter number of students : 4
Enter Number of Teacher : 4

Enter arrival time of Student 1 = 0
Enter arrival time of Student 2 = 3
Enter arrival time of Student 3 = 4
Enter arrival time of Student 4 = 8
Enter arrival time of Faculty 1 = 0
Enter arrival time of Faculty 2 = 2
Enter arrival time of Faculty 3 = 3
Enter arrival time of Faculty 4 = 6

Faculty 1 will issue the book
Student 1 will issue the book
Faculty 2 will issue the book
Faculty 3 will issue the book
Student 2 will issue the book
Student 3 will issue the book
Faculty 4 will issue the book
Student 4 will issue the book
